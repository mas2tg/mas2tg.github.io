Hello there! My name is Marco and I am originally from [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), a city in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. I came to the US to study Computer Engineering at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) and I have been here since then. I plan to start my PhD in Computer Science in the Fall of 2021.

I enjoy working out, doing things like running (I once ran a half-marathon!), calisthenics, and bouldering. The scariest thing I ever done in my life was to rappel a 6000 feet rock in Moab, UT (see picture below). It's a great experience, *after the fact*.![looking\_glass](moab.jpeg)*Looking Glass Rock, near Moab UT.* 

I also enjoy reading about *consciouness*, and how it came to be. In a nushell, I don't think humans are anywhere near in replicating it with machines -- *we barely underestand how our brain works!* If you are also a fan of the topic, please reach out and let's have a conversation about it! Here are some books that have influenced my thoughts about the subject:

Books:
- A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence (Jeff Hawkins, 2021)
- How to Change Your Mind (Michael Pollan, 2018)
- From Bacteria To Bach and Back (Dennet, 2017)
- Godel, Escher and Bach (Hofstadter 1979)

Talks: 
- [Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg&list=ULMea0u1FfOcM) (Searle, 2015)
- [The scientific pursuit of consiousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHRbnNwIg1g) (Koch, 2014) 
- [How do you explain consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhRhtFFhNzQ) (Chalmers, 2014) *as a tidbit, Chalmers coined the famous idea of "hard problem of consciousness"*

In my free time I also love playing videogames, especially well written immersive RPGs [(check this one out)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Eternity).
