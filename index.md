<p>Welcome to my webpage! I am a Computer Engineering M.S. student at the University of Virginia. My work primarily lies in <b>cybersecurity</b> and <b>systems security</b>. Keep reading to learn more about some projects I have worked on in the past. I am currently being advised by <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/yixin-sun">Yixin Sun</a>.</p>

<b>Traffic Analysis on Tor and LTE/4G</b> 
<i>(June 2020 - present)</i>
<p>Working with <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~cs7dt/home.html">Cong Shen</a> and Yixin on a project that aims to perform traffic analysis on the Tor network and layer-2 LTE packets. In our simulation, we use <a href="https://shadow.github.io/">shadow</a> for the Tor componenet, and <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/">ns3</a> for the LTE side. We are on track to perform tests on a physical testbed in the Spring of 2021. </p>
<b>Program segmentation based on framework APIs</b> <i>(Oct 2019 - Jun 2020)</i>
<p>I worked on a C++ system whose goal was to delegate the execution of a given framework API to a subprocess, reducing the attack surface of framework exploits. The delegating program would pass all the necessary data to the other processes through IPC using shared memory.</p>

<p>After undergrad, I also spent 2 years working at Goldman Sachs as a Technology Analyst. I was part of the Workflow team, who managed various business processes in the firm through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation">BPMNs</a>. My responsibilities were those of an SRE (site-reliability engineer), trying to solve incidents when they arised, and reducing <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/">toil</a> everywhery as needed. </p>
