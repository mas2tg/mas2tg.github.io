<p>Welcome to my webpage! I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California being advised by <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/">William Halfond</a>. My main areas of interest are <i>Software Engineering</i>, <i>Program Analysis</i> and <i>Software Security</i>. Right now I am learning a lot about Android's Inter-Component-Communication (ICC) and how we can apply program analysis techniques to detect ICC vulnerabilities in Android apps. Keep reading to learn more about some projects I have worked on in the past. </p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<b>Traffic Analysis on Tor and LTE/4G</b> 
<i>(Jun 2020 - May 2021)</i>
<p>Worked with <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ys3kz/">Yixin Sun (advisor)</a> and <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~cs7dt/home.html">Cong Shen</a> on a project that performed traffic correlation attacks on the Tor network and layer-2 LTE packets. In our experiments, we used <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/">ns3</a> for simulating the LTE network and previously recorded real-world Tor traffic for analysis. You can read more about my thesis <a href="https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/xk81jm023">here</a>. </p>
<b>Program segmentation based on framework APIs</b> <i>(Oct 2019 - Jun 2020)</i>
<p>I worked on a C++ system whose goal was to delegate the execution of a given framework API to a subprocess, reducing the attack surface of framework exploits. The delegating program would pass all the necessary data to the other processes through IPC using shared memory.</p>

<div> <b>Goldman Sachs </b> <i>(Sep 2017 - July 2019)</i>
<p>After undergrad, I spent 2 years working at Goldman Sachs as a Technology Analyst. I was part of the Workflow team, who managed various business processes in the firm through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation">BPMNs</a>. My responsibilities were those of an SRE (site-reliability engineer), trying to solve incidents when they arised, and reducing <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/">toil</a> everywhery as needed. </p>
